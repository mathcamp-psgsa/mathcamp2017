# Resources:
- Basic R tutorial
    - Going to recommend Swirl: http://swirlstats.com/students.html
    - Could use codeschool: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r
    - Could use Datacamp: https://www.datacamp.com/
    - Others?
- Github with R
    - http://happygitwithr.com/

# Instructors:
- Faculty: Alicia.

# Details

## Day 1 (Aug 14): Algebra + calc
- Introduction (9:30am)
    - What we use math for: 
    - Identifying an effect of X on Y
    - Conditions: when X –> Y?
    - Mechanism: how X –> Y?
    - Need mathematics to determine if Y increases as X increases (simple version).
- Module One (10:00am-12:00pm)
    - Algebra & calculus
- Module Two (1:30pm-3:30pm)
    - Algebra & calculus

## Day 2 (Aug 15): Probability & Statistics
- Review (9:30am)
    - Review & questions from algebra & calculus
- Module One (10:00am-12:00pm)
    - Probability & statistics
    - Statistics as describing variation
    - Descriptive statistics (means, modes, medians, etc...)
    - Logic
    - More advanced topics
- Module Two (1:30pm-3:30pm)
    - Probability & statistics
    - Statistics as describing variation
    - Descriptive statistics (means, modes, medians, etc...)
    - Logic
    - More advanced topics

## Day 3 (Aug 16): Introduction to R
- Review (9:30am)
    - Review & questions from probability & statistics
- Module One (10:00am-12:00pm)
    - Types of data
        - Characters, factors, numerics
        - Types of objects
        - Scalars, vectors, matrices, dataframes.
    - R programming as a language
        - Functions are verbs
        - Objects as direct objects (thing verb acts on)
- Module Two (1:30pm-3:30pm)
    - Basic functions
    - Structure of data
        - rows (units of analysis) and columns (variables/characteristics that describe units of analysis)
        - Indexing [row,column]
    - Troubleshooting with Google (stackoverflow)

## Day 4 (Aug 17): Workflow – Rmarkdown, LaTex, GitHub
- Review (9:30am)
    - Review & questions from probability & statistics
- Module One (10:00am-12:00pm)
    - Workflow: what is workflow?
    - Data management & replicability
    - Tools for Workflow: Rmarkdown
        - code chunks & their options
        - plots in rmarkdown
        - inline code
        - knitting
    - Tools for Workflow: LaTex
- Module Two (1:30pm-3:30pm)

    - Typical plots: 
        - barplots
        - histograms
        - line graphs
        - others
- Module Two (1:30pm-3:30pm)
    - Goal of methods: 
        - detect effect of X on Y
        - conditions under which X effects Y
        - mechanism through which X effects Y
    - How do algebra, calculus, and statistics help us do social science?
